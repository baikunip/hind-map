Over the years, rapid development and overgrazing, combined with rising temperatures have threatened soil quality and biodiversity, and exacerbated water scarcity.  Combating desertification has fast become a pressing concern for the country. With the aim of restoring 200 million hectares of degraded land at home and abroad, Saudi Arabia has extended safeguards for 18 per cent of its land, up from 4 per cent earlier, and has steadily increased the number of national parks.","title":"Saudi Arabia"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[44.73443238382529,23.275187741326604],"type":"Point"}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"indicators":"Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)","spei":"Drought is a recurring feature of the Australian landscape.

Addressing climate change will be critical to the country’s pursuit of sustainable, low-emission economic growth. Climate change impacts threaten Senegal’s infrastructure, biodiversity, food security, nutrition, health, productivity, agroecological systems, and economic growth. Heat stress, seasonal shifts in the prevalence of malaria, and respiratory diseases caused by intensifying air pollution are likely to increase morbidity and mortality.",
